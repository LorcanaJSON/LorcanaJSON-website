        <p>
            <i18n>
                This project aims to collect data about all the cards in the <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span>
                trading card game, and to make that data accessible in an easy-to-use format.
            </i18n>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i18n>
                It's aimed at developers of <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span> tools and websites, rather than
                players of the game. Having one source of data should save these developers time, since everybody
                doesn't individually have to collect and enter their own card data anymore.
            </i18n>

        <p>
            <i18n>There are three types of files: A metadata file; a file for each set; and the file with all the
                cards.
            </i18n>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i18n>Each data file type has its own use and fields:</i18n>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <i18n>
                        <b class="filename">metadata.json</b> contains data about the data files. Storing these values
                        and occassionally retrieving just this file is an efficient way to check if the datafiles got
                        updated, in which case you need to redownload them to get the latest version of the card data.
                        This datablock is also included in the other data files under the "metadata" key. It consists of
                        these fields:
                    </i18n>

                    <li><b class="field">formatVersion</b>
                        <i18n>
                            A string indicating the formatting version of the files, in
                            <code class="version">major.minor.patch</code> format. If this version string changes, the
                            data structure was changed, and your tool that uses these data files might need
                            adjustments. You can check the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for the exact changes
                        </i18n>

                            data files were generated. If this field changes, new cards may have been added or existing ones changed.

                     <li><b class="field">hasAllCards</b>
                        <i18n>
                            A boolean indicating whether all cards for this set have been released yet.
                            <code class="json-keyword">true</code> if all main cards (so excluding promos) of the set are in the datafile,

                            The number of the set, within the set's 'type'. So both setcode "1" and "Q1" have 'number' 1, since the former is expansion 1 and the latter is quest 1. See also the <code class="field ref">type</code> field

                        <i18n>
                            What type of set this is. Most sets are type <code class="on-card">expansion</code>, but sets like 'Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble' are type <code class="on-card">quest</code>. The latter type may be missing some fields or values, and cards from these sets aren't allowed to be used during tournaments or official games

            <i18n>
                The <code class="filename ref">allCards.json</code> file and all the set files have a
                <code class="field ref">cards</code> field, which contains a list of card objects.
            </i18n>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i18n>Each of those card objects consists of the following fields:</i18n>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="optional field">abilities</b>
                <i18n>
                    A list of all abilities on this character card.
                    For character-type cards, abilities are generally keywords, like 'Evasive' and 'Shift', and this
                    field includes the ability name, its value if it has one, and its reminder text. For action-type and item-type
                    cards, this field contains what the action does. For cards without abilities, this field doesn't exist
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">artist</b>
                <i18n> The name(s) of the artist(s) that drew the art for this card</i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">baseName</b>
                <i18n>
                    The main name of the card. For characters and locations, this is the character or location name without the subtitle. For
                    other card types, this is the same as the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field. See also the <code class="field ref">fullName</code>
                    and <code class="field ref">subtitle</code> fields
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">clarifications</b>
                <i18n>
                    Some cards have extra clarifications for how they work or interact with other cards. This field is a
                    list of those clarifications. For cards without clarifications, this field doesn't exist. The text
                    can contain newline characters

            </li>
            <li><b class="field">code</b>
                <i18n>
                        This field is the two-character code for this card that the official app uses internally when saving a deck. It is the base-62 version of the card ID (digits higher than 9 use lowercase a-z and then uppercase A-Z). See also the <code class="field">id</code> field
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">color</b>
                <i18n>The name of the color of the card. One of Amber, Amethyst, Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, Stee. Cards from Quest-type sets don't have a color, so for those, this field is an empty string</i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">cost</b>
                <i18n>How much Ink this card costs to play</i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">effects</b>
                <i18n>
                    A list of all the effects this card has. Each entry in the 'effects' list is a dictionary with

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">enchantedId</b>
                <i18n>
                    For cards that have an Enchanted version, this field contains the ID of that Enchanted card. For
                    other cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">nonEnchantedId</code>

                <i18n>
                    Some cards have errata, correcting mistakes on the card, and/or improving phrasing. This field is a
                    list of those corrections. For cards without errata, this field doesn't exist. The text can contain
                    newline characters
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">flavorText</b>
                <i18n>
                    The flavor text at the bottom of a card. This has no gameplay effect, but does improve the feel of
                    the card. For cards without flavor text, this field doesn't exist. The text can contain newline
                    characters
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">fullIdentifier</b>
                <i18n>
                    The full identifier as displayed on the bottom-left of each card, for instance
                    <code class="on-card">9/204 • EN • 3</code>.
                    The formatting may be different for promo cards. See also the <code class="field ref">number</code>

                <i18n>
                    The full name of the card. For characters and locations, this is the <code class="field ref">baseName</code> plus the <code class="field ref">subtitle</code>, separated by a dash.
                    For other card types this is the same as the <code class="field ref">baseName</code> field.

                <i18n>
                    The entire main gameplay text on the card as printed, not split up into abilities or effects. Does not
                    include the flavor text. This field always exists, but can be an empty string on cards without text.
                    The text can contain newline characters

                <i18n>
                    A unique number identifying the card. For the first set, this id is identical to the
                    <code class="field ref">number</code> field; for subsequent sets, the id keeps counting up (so the
                    first card of set&nbsp;2 has an id one higher than the last card of set&nbsp;1). The id is identical
                    between different language versions of the same card
                </i18n>
            </li>

                            <i18n>The URL of the card image at full size, usually 1468 by 2048 pixels</i18n>

                                A mask of the full card image that the official
                                <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span> app uses to draw
                                the foil effect, usually 1468 by 2048 pixels. Not all cards have this field
                            </i18n>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <i18n>
                        Note: If the <code class="field ref">isExternalReveal</code> field exists and is set to
                        <code class="json-keyword">true</code>, this card isn't in the official app yet, so only the
                        'full' image field will be set
                    </i18n>

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">isExternalReveal</b>
                <i18n>
                    If this field exists and is <code class="json-keyword">true</code>, the data from this card didn't come from the official
                    app, but the card image came from another official Ravensburger source. Practically, this means that the
                    <code class="field ref">images</code> field will probably only have the <code class="field ref">full</code> URL set,
                    and it will be in another format than usual. This field doesn't exist if the data for this card came from the official app

                <i18n>
                    A list of the keyword abilities of this character card, without the reminder text. For keyword
                    abilities with a value, like <code class="on-card">Shift X</code> or
                    <code class="on-card">Challenger +X</code>, the list entry includes that value. For cards
                    without keyword abilities, this field doesn't exist

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">lore</b>
                <i18n>
                    For character cards, this is the amount of lore this character earns for a player when they
                    quest with it. For characters that can't quest, this value is 0. For location cards, this is the
                    amount of lore this location card earns at the start of each turn. For other card types, this field doesn't exist
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">moveCost</b>
                <i18n>
                    For location cards, this is the amount of ink it costs to move a character to this location. For
                    other cards, this field doesn't exist
                </i18n>

            <li><b class="optional field">nonEnchantedId</b>
                <i18n>
                    For Enchanted-rarity cards, this field contains the ID of the non-Enchanted version of the same
                    card. For non-Enchanted-rarity cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">enchantedId</code> field

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">nonPromoId</b>
                <i18n>
                    Special versions of some cards are released at events or at other occasions, as promo versions.
                    For these cards, this field points to the ID of the non-promo version of the same card. For other
                    cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">promoIds</code> field

                    in the bottom left of the card and in the <code class="field ref">fullIdentifier</code> field.
                    For 'Special'-rarity cards, this number is the promo number instead, so a set
                    might have two cards with number 1, one Special and one non-Special.
                    This doesn't necessarily mean the cards are related, for that see the <code class="field ref">promoIds</code> and <code class="field ref">nonSpecialId</code> fields.
                    For a unique card identifier, see the <code class="field ref">id</code> field

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">promoIds</b>
                <i18n>
                    Special versions of some cards are released at events or at other occasions, as promo versions.
                    For cards that have such promo versions, this field has a list of IDs of those promo
                    versions of this non-promo card. For cards without a promo version, this field doesn't exist.
                    See also the <code class="field ref">nonPromoId</code> field

            </li>
            <li><b class="field">rarity</b>
                <i18n>
                    The rarity of this card. One of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Super Rare, Legendary, Enchanted, or Special
                    (the latter is used for promos or other special releases)
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">setCode</b>
                <i18n>
                        A string representation of the set code, which is the set number for 'normal' cards, and <code class="on-card">Q1</code> for Illumineer's Quest cards. This is exactly how it's printed as the last part of the identifier at the bottom-left of each card.<br />
                        This set code is also a key in the "sets" dictionary inside the "allCards.json" file, linking to the set name and other set data.<br />
                        This field does not exist in the set-specific data files, since it doesn't make sense there. See also the <code class="field ref">setNumber</code> field
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">setNumber</b>
                <i18n>
                    The number of the set this card is released in. For cards from Quest sets (f.i. Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble), this field does not exist<br />
                    This field also does not exist in the set-specific data files, since it doesn't make sense there. See also the <code class="field ref">setCode</code> field
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">simpleName</b>
                <i18n>
                    The full name like in the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field, but simplified: without
                    the dash between base name and subtitle (for character and location cards), without special characters like
                    '!' and '.', and entirely in lower-case.
                    Special versions of letters are simplified too (for instance: "Te Kā - The Burning One" has the
                    simpleName "te ka the burning one"). Quotemarks in possessives ("captain colonel's lieutenant") and dashes between words ("minnie
                    mouse wide-eyed diver") <i>are</i> kept, since that's related to basic spelling.
                    This field should make it easier to implement this data in a search engine, since most people
                    won't use the dash or other special characters when searching for a card, so you can match their
                    query against this field. See also the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field
                </i18n>

            <li><b class="field">story</b>
                <i18n>
                    The name of the story (movie, show, etc.) that the card is from or that it references
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">strength</b>
                <i18n>
                    The strength of a character card, so how much damage it does to another character during a
                    challenge. For card types other than characters, this field doesn't exist
                </i18n>
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">subtitle</b>
                <i18n>
                    The subtitle of a character or location card, which is a suffix to the baseName. For other card
                    types, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field
                </i18n>

                <i18n>
                    A list of the subtypes of this card. For characters, this can have entries like
                    <code class="on-card">Dreamborn</code> and <code class="on-card">Princess</code>. For song actions,
                    this contains 'Song'. The order of the list is the same as on the card. For cards without subtypes,
                    this field doesn't exist

            <li><b class="optional field">variant</b>
                <i18n>
                    Some cards have multiple variants that only have different art (for instance
                    <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy</code> has ID 436 to 440).
                    These are differentiated by a letter after the card number (for <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy</code>, letters 'a' to 'e').
                    This field contains that letter. For cards without variants, this field doesn't exist.

                    <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy</code> has ID 436 to 440).
                    This field contains a list of the IDs of the other cards belonging to this variant. For cards without

                The source of all this data is the same as the official
                <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span> app uses, with extra image parsing to make the card text
                more accurate. This means that LorcanaJSON files don't contain all cards teased for the next set release.<br />
                Once the new set cards get added to the official app, they will also get added to the LorcanaJSON data
                files within a few days.
