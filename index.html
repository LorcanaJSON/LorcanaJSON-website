                This project aims to collect data about all the cards in the Disney Lorcana trading card game, and to
                make that data accessible in an easy-to-use format.
            </i18n>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i18n>
                It's aimed at developers of Disney Lorcana tools and websites, rather than players of the game. Having
                one source of data should save these developers time, since everybody doesn't individually have to
                collect and enter their own card data anymore.
            </i18n>

        </h1>
        <p>There are three types of files: A metadata file; a file for each set; and the file with all the cards.</p>
        <p>Each data file type has its own use and fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>metadata.json</strong> contains data about the data files. Storing these values and
                occassionally retrieving just this file is an efficient way to check if the datafiles got updated, in
                which case you need to redownload them to get the latest version of the card data. This datablock is
                also included in the other data files under the "metadata" key. It consists of these fields:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>formatVersion</strong>: A string indicating the formatting version of the files, in
                        'major.minor.path' format. If this version string changes, the data structure was changed, and
                        your tool that uses these data files might need adjustments</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>generatedOn</strong>: An ISO 8601 formatted date and time string, indicating when the
                        data files were generated. If field changes,</p>

            <li><strong>setdata.[setnumber].json</strong> contains data on all the cards in the set specified by the
                setnumber. There is a file like this for each released set. It consists of these fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>code</strong>: The three-letter code for this set</li>
                    <li><strong>hasAllCards</strong>: A boolean indicating whether all cards for this set have been
                        released yet. 'true' if all cards of the set are in the datafile, 'false' otherwise
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>name</strong>: The full name of this set</li>

        </h1>
        The 'allCards.json' file and all the set files have a 'cards' field, which contains a list of card
        objects.
        Each of those card objects consists of the following fields:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>abilities</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of all abilities on this character card. For
                character-type cards, abilities are generally keywords, like 'Evasive' and 'Shift', and this field
                includes the ability name, its value, and its reminder text. For action-type and item-type cards, this
                field contains what the action does. For cards without abilities, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li><strong>artist</strong>: The name(s) of the artist(s) that drew the art for this card</li>
            <li><strong>baseName</strong>: The main name of the card. For characters, this is the character name,
                without the subtitle. For other card types, this is the same as the 'fullName' field. See also the
                'fullName' and 'subtitle' fields
            </li>
            <li><strong>clarifications</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: Some cards have extra clarifications for how they
                work or interact with other cards. This field is a list of those clarifications. For cards without
                clarifications, this field doesn't exist. The text can contain newline characters
            </li>
            <li><strong>color</strong>:
                The name of the color of the card. One of Amber, Amethyst, Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, Steel
            </li>
            <li><strong>cost</strong>: How much Ink this card costs to play</li>
            <li><strong>effects</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of all the effects this card has. Each entry in the
                'effects' list is a dictionary with two values:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>name</strong>: The name of this effect. This is always fully uppercase</li>
                    <li><strong>text</strong>: The description of what the ability actually does</li>
                </ul>
                For cards without effects, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li><strong>enchantedId</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: For cards that have an Enchanted version, this field
                contains the ID of that Enchanted card. For other cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the
                'nonEnchantedId' field
            </li>
            <li><strong>errata</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: Some cards have errata, correcting mistakes on the card,
                and/or improving phrasing. This field is a list of those corrections. For cards without errata, this
                field doesn't exist. The text can contain newline characters
            </li>
            <li><strong>flavorText</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: The flavor text at the bottom of a card. This has no
                gameplay effect, but does improve the feel of the card. For cards without flavor text, this field
                doesn't exist. The text can contain newline characters
            </li>
            <li><strong>fullIdentifier</strong>: The full identifier as displayed on the bottom-left of each card, for
                instance '9/204 • EN • 3'. The formatting may be different for promo cards. See also the 'number' and
                'setNumber' fields
            </li>
            <li><strong>fullName</strong>: The full name of the card. For characters, this is the baseName plus the
                subtitle. For other card types this is the same as the 'baseName' field. See also the 'baseName' and
                'subtitle' fields
            </li>
            <li><strong>fullText</strong>: The main gameplay text on the card as printed, not split up into abilities or
                effects. Does not include the flavor text. This field always exists, but can be an empty string on cards
                without text. The text can contain newline characters
            </li>
            <li><strong>id</strong>: A unique number identifying the card. For the first set, this id is identical to
                the 'number' field; for subsequent sets the id keeps counting up (so the first card of set 2 has an id
                one higher than the last card of set 1). The id is identical between different language versions of the
                same card
            </li>
            <li><strong>images</strong>: A dictionary with several URLs of card images. These images are the same ones
                as used in the official <i>Disney Lorcana</i> app The fields in this dictionary are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>full</strong>: The URL of the card image at full size, usually 1468 by 2048 pixels</li>
                    <li><strong>thumbnail</strong>: The URL of the card image at thumbnail size, usually 367 by 512
                        pixels
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>foilMask</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: A mask of the full card image that the official <i>Disney
                        Lorcana</i> app uses to draw the foil effect, usually 1468 by 2048 pixels. Not all cards
                        have this field
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Note: If the 'isExternalReveal' field exists and is set to True, this card isn't in the official
                app yet, so only the 'full' image field will be set
            </li>
            <li><strong>inkwell</strong>: 'true' if this card is allowed to be put into the inkwell for ink, so if it
                has the extra decoration around the cost in the top left of the card, and 'false' otherwise
            </li>
            <li><strong>isExternalReveal</strong> <i>(optional)</i>:This field is missing if the data for this card came
                from the official app. If this field exists and is True, the data from this card didn't come from the
                official app, but the card image came from another official Ravensburger source. Practically, this means
                that the 'images' field will probalby only have the 'full' URL set, and it may be in another format than
                usual
            </li>
            <li><strong>keywordAbilities</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of the keyword abilities of this character
                card, without the reminder text. For keyword abilities with a value, like 'Shift X' or 'Challenger +X',
                the list entry includes that value. For characters without keyword abilities and card types other than
                characters, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li><strong>lore</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: For character cards, this is the amount of lore this character
                earns for a player when they quest with it. For characters that can't quest, this value is 0. For
                location cards, this is the amount of lore this location card earns at the start of each turn. For other
                card types, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li><strong>moveCost</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: For location cards, this is the amount of ink it costs to
                move a character to this location. For other cards, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li><strong>nonEnchantedId</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: For Enchanted-rarity cards, this field contains the
                ID of the non-Enchanted version of the same card. For non-Enchanted-rarity cards, this field doesn't
                exist. See also the 'enchantedId' field
            </li>
            <li><strong>nonPromoId</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: . For these cards, this field points to ID of the
                non-promo version of the same card. For other cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the 'promoIds'
                field
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>number</strong>: The number of the card inside its set, shown as 'number/totalCards' in the
                    bottom left of the card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For 'Special'-rarity cards, this number is the promo number instead, so a set
                    might have two cards with number 1, one Special and one non-Special.
                    This doesn't mean the cards are related, for that see the 'specialId' and 'nonSpecialId' fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a unique identifier, see the 'id' field
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>promoIds</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: Special versions of some cards are released at events
                    or at other occasions, as 'promo' versions. For cards that have such promo versions, this field has
                    a list of IDs of those promo versions of this non-promo card. For other cards, this field doesn't
                    exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See also the 'nonPromoId' field
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>rarity</strong>: The rarity of this card. One of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Super Rare,
                    Legendary, Enchanted, or Special (the latter is used for promos or other special releases)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>setNumber</strong>: The number of the set this card is released in. This field does not
                    exist in the set-specific data files, since it doesn't make sense there
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>simpleName</strong>: The full name like in the 'fullName' field, but simplified: without the
                    dash between base name and subtitle (for character cards), without special characters like '!' and
                    '.', and entirely in lower-case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Special versions of letters are simplified too (for instance: "Te Kā - The Burning One" has the
                    simpleName "te ka the burning one").
                </p>
                <p>Quotemarks in possessives ("captain colonel's lieutenant") and dashes between words ("minnie
                    mouse wide-eyed diver") <i>are</i> still in there, since that's related to basic spelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This field should make it easier to implement this data in a search engine, since most people
                    won't use the dash or other special characters when searching for a card, so you can match their
                    query against this field
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>story</strong>: The name of the story (movie, show, etc.) that the (character on the) card is
                from or that it references

            <li>
                <strong>strength</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: The strength of a character card, so how much damage it
                does to another character during a challenge. For card types other than characters, this field doesn't
                exist
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>subtitle</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: The subtitle of a character or location card, which is a
                suffix to the baseName. For other card types, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>subtypes</strong> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of the subtypes of this card. For characters, this
                can have entries like 'Dreamborn' and 'Princess'. For song actions, this contains 'Song'.
                The order of the list is the same as on the card. For cards without subtypes, this field doesn't
                exist
            </li>
            <li>

        <p>
            The source of all this data is the same as the official <i>Disney Lorcana</i> app uses, with extra image
            parsing to make the card text more accurate. This means that LorcanaJSON files don't contain all cards
            teased for the next set release.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the new set cards get added to the official app, they will also get added to the LorcanaJSON data
            files within a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data files also don't contain any information about 'Enchanted'-rarity cards or links to their art.
