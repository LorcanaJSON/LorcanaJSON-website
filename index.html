                This project aims to collect data about all the cards in the Disney Lorcana trading card game, and to
                make that data accessible in an easy-to-use format.<br/>
                It's aimed at developers of Disney Lorcana tools and websites, rather than players of the game. Having
                one source of data should save these developers time, since everybody doesn't individually have to
                collect and enter their own card data anymore.<br/>
                This project is not affiliated with Ravensburger or Disney.
            </section>

            <section id="datafiles"><h3>Data files explanation</h3>
                There are three types of files: A metadata file; a file for each set; and the file with all the cards.
                <br/>
                Each data file type has its own use and fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>metadata.json</b> contains data about the data files. Storing these values and occassionally
                        retrieving just this file is an efficient way to check if the datafiles got updated, in which
                        case
                        you need to redownload them to get the latest version of the card data. This datablock is also
                        included in the other data files under the "metadata" key. It consists of these fields:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>formatVersion</b>: A string indicating the formatting version of the files, in
                                'major.minor.path' format. If this version string changes, the data structure was
                                changed,
                                and your tool that uses these data files might need adjustments
                            </li>
                            <li><b>generatedOn</b>: An ISO 8601 formatted date and time string, indicating when the data
                                files were generated. If field changes,
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>setdata.[setnumber].json</b> contains data on all the cards in the set specified by the
                        setnumber. There is a file like this for each released set. It consists of these fields:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>code</b>: The three-letter code for this set</li>
                            <li><b>hasAllCards</b>: A boolean indicating whether all cards for this set have been
                                released
                                yet. 'true' if all cards of the set are in the datafile, 'false' otherwise
                            </li>
                            <li><b>metadata</b>: Contains the same metadata fields as in metadata.json, as described
                                above
                            </li>
                            <li><b>name</b>: The full name of this set</li>
                            <li><b>prereleaseDate</b>: The pre-release date for this set, when it was or will be
                                available
                                to buy from local game stores. Format is year-month-day
                            </li>
                            <li><b>releaseDate</b>: The release date for this set, when it was or will be available to
                                buy
                                from large retailers, and the Ravensburger and ShopDisney websites. Format is
                                year-month-day
                            </li>
                            <li><b>cards</b>: A list of card objects. The fields of each object are described in the
                                next

                    </li>
                    <li><b>allCards.json</b> contains data on all the cards that have been released for Disney Lorcana.
                        It consists of these fields:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>metadata</b>: Contains the same metadata fields as in metadata.json, as described

                            <li><b>sets</b>: A dictionary with set data. There is a key for each set number, and the
                                values are the same set data as described above for the set-specific datafiles
                            </li>
                            <li><b>cards</b>: A list of card objects. The fields of each object are described in the

            <section id="field-explanation"><h3>Card data fields explanation</h3>
                The 'allCards.json' file and all the set files have a 'cards' field, which contains a list of card
                objects.
                Each of those card objects consists of the following fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>abilities</b> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of all abilities on this character card. For
                        character-type cards, abilities are generally keywords, like 'Evasive' and 'Shift', and this
                        field
                        includes the ability name, its value, and its reminder text. For action-type and item-type
                        cards,
                        this field contains what the action does. For cards without abilities, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>artist</b>: The name(s) of the artist(s) that drew the art for this card</li>
                    <li><b>baseName</b>: The main name of the card. For characters, this is the character name, without
                        the
                        subtitle. For other card types, this is the same as the 'fullName' field. See also the
                        'fullName'
                        and 'subtitle' fields
                    </li>
                    <li><b>clarifications</b> <i>(optional)</i>: Some cards have extra clarifications for how they work
                        or
                        interact with other cards. This field is a list of those clarifications. For cards without
                        clarifications, this field doesn't exist. The text can contain newline characters
                    </li>
                    <li><b>color</b>: The name of the color of the card. One of Amber, Amethyst, Emerald, Ruby,
                        Sapphire,
                        Steel
                    </li>
                    <li><b>cost</b>: How much Ink this card costs to play</li>
                    <li><b>effects</b> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of all the effects this card has. Each entry in the
                        'effects' list is a dictionary with two values:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>name</b>: The name of this effect. This is always fully uppercase</li>
                            <li><b>text</b>: The description of what the ability actually does</li>
                        </ul>
                        For cards without effects, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>enchantedId</b> <i>(optional)</i>: For cards that have an Enchanted version, this field
                        contains
                        the ID of that Enchanted card. For other cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the
                        'nonEnchantedId' field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>errata</b> <i>(optional)</i>: Some cards have errata, correcting mistakes on the card, and/or
                        improving phrasing. This field is a list of those corrections. For cards without errata, this
                        field
                        doesn't exist. The text can contain newline characters
                    </li>
                    <li><b>flavorText</b> <i>(optional)</i>: The flavor text at the bottom of a card. This has no
                        gameplay
                        effect, but does improve the feel of the card. For cards without flavor text, this field doesn't
                        exist. The text can contain newline characters
                    </li>
                    <li><b>fullIdentifier</b>: The full identifier as displayed on the bottom-left of each card, for
                        instance '9/204 • EN • 3'. The formatting may be different for promo cards. See also the
                        'number'
                        and 'setNumber' fields
                    </li>
                    <li><b>fullName</b>: The full name of the card. For characters, this is the baseName plus the
                        subtitle.
                        For other card types this is the same as the 'baseName' field. See also the 'baseName' and
                        'subtitle' fields
                    </li>
                    <li><b>fullText</b>: The main gameplay text on the card as printed, not split up into abilities or
                        effects. Does not include the flavor text. This field always exists, but can be an empty string
                        on
                        cards without text. The text can contain newline characters
                    </li>
                    <li><b>id</b>: A unique number identifying the card. For the first set, this id is identical to the
                        'number' field; for subsequent sets the id keeps counting up (so the first card of set 2 has an
                        id
                        one higher than the last card of set 1). The id is identical between different language versions
                        of
                        the same card
                    </li>
                    <li><b>images</b>: A dictionary with several URLs of card images. These images are the same ones as
                        used
                        in the official <i>Disney Lorcana</i> app The fields in this dictionary are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>full</b>: The URL of the card image at full size, usually 1468 by 2048 pixels</li>
                            <li><b>thumbnail</b>: The URL of the card image at thumbnail size, usually 367 by 512 pixels
                            </li>
                            <li><b>foilMask</b> <i>(optional)</i>: A mask of the full card image that the official <i>Disney
                                Lorcana</i> app uses to draw the foil effect, usually 1468 by 2048 pixels. Not all cards
                                have this field
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Note: If the 'isExternalReveal' field exists and is set to True, this card isn't in the official
                        app
                        yet, so only the 'full' image field will be set
                    </li>
                    <li><b>inkwell</b>: 'true' if this card is allowed to be put into the inkwell for ink, so if it has
                        the
                        extra decoration around the cost in the top left of the card, and 'false' otherwise
                    </li>
                    <li><b>isExternalReveal</b> <i>(optional)</i>: This field is missing if the data for this card came
                        from
                        the official app. If this field exists and is True, the data from this card didn't come from the
                        official app, but the card image came from another official Ravensburger source. Practically,
                        this
                        means that the 'images' field will probalby only have the 'full' URL set, and it will be in
                        another
                        format than usual
                    </li>
                    <li><b>keywordAbilities</b> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of the keyword abilities of this character
                        card,
                        without the reminder text. For keyword abilities with a value, like 'Shift X' or 'Challenger
                        +X',
                        the list entry includes that value.
                        For characters without keyword abilities and card types other than characters, this field

                        for a player when they quest with it. For characters that can't quest, this value is 0. For
                        location
                        cards, this is the amount of lore this location card earns at the start of each turn. For other
                        card
                        types, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>moveCost</b> <i>(optional)</i>: For location cards, this is the amount of ink it costs to
                        move a
                        character to this location. For other cards, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>nonEnchantedId</b> <i>(optional)</i>: For Enchanted-rarity cards, this field contains the ID
                        of
                        the non-Enchanted version of the same card. For non-Enchanted-rarity cards, this field doesn't
                        exist. See also the 'enchantedId' field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>nonPromoId</b> <i>(optional)</i>: . For these cards, this field points to ID of the non-promo
                        version of the same card. For other cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the 'promoIds'

                    </li>
                    <li><b>number</b>: The number of the card inside its set, shown as 'number/totalCards' in the bottom
                        left of the card. For 'Special'-rarity cards, this number is the promo number instead, so a set
                        might have two cards with number 1, one Special and one non-Special. This doesn't mean the cards
                        are
                        related, for that see the 'specialId' and 'nonSpecialId' fields. For a unique identifier, see
                        the
                        'id' field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>promoIds</b> <i>(optional)</i>: Special versions of some cards are released at events or at
                        other
                        occasions, as 'promo' versions. For cards that have such promo versions, this field has a list
                        of
                        IDs of those promo versions of this non-promo card. For other cards, this field doesn't exist.
                        See
                        also the 'nonPromoId' field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>rarity</b>: The rarity of this card. One of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Super Rare, Legendary,
                        Enchanted, or Special (the latter is used for promos or other special releases)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>setNumber</b>: The number of the set this card is released in. This field does not exist in
                        the
                        set-specific data files, since it doesn't make sense there
                    </li>
                    <li><b>simpleName</b>: The full name like in the 'fullName' field, but simplified: without the dash
                        between base name and subtitle (for character cards), without special characters like '!' and
                        '.',
                        and entirely in lower-case.
                        Special versions of letters are simplified too (for instance: "Te Kā - The Burning One" has the
                        simpleName "te ka the burning one").<br/>
                        Quotemarks in possessives ("captain colonel's lieutenant") and dashes between words ("minnie
                        mouse
                        wide-eyed diver") <i>are</i> still in there, since that's related to basic spelling. <br/>
                        This field should make it easier to implement this data in a search engine, since most people
                        won't
                        use the dash or other special characters when searching for a card, so you can match their query
                        against this field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>story</b>: The name of the story (movie, show, etc.) that the (character on the) card is from
                        or
                        that it references
                    </li>
                    <li><b>strength</b> <i>(optional)</i>: The strength of a character card, so how much damage it does
                        to
                        another character during a challenge. For card types other than characters, this field doesn't
                        exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>subtitle</b> <i>(optional)</i>: The subtitle of a character or location card, which is a
                        suffix
                        to the baseName. For other card types, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>subtypes</b> <i>(optional)</i>: A list of the subtypes of this card. For characters, this can
                        have entries like 'Dreamborn' and 'Princess'. For song actions, this contains 'Song'.
                        The order of the list is the same as on the card. For cards without subtypes, this field doesn't
                        exist
                    </li>
                    <li><b>type</b>: What kind of card this is. One of Action, Character, Item</li>
                    <li><b>variant</b> <i>(optional)</i>: Some cards have multiple variants that only have different art
                        (for instance 'Dalmatian Puppy' (ID 436 to 440). These are differentiated by a letter (for
                        'Dalmatian Puppy', letters 'a' to 'e'). This field contains that letter. For cards without
                        variants,
                        this field doesn't exist. See also the 'variantIds' field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>variantIds</b> <i>(optional)</i>: Some cards have multiple variants that only have different
                        art
                        (for instance 'Dalmatian Puppy' (ID 436 to 440). This field contains a list of the IDs of the
                        other
                        cards belonging to this variant. For cards without variants, this field doesn't exist. See also
                        the
                        'variant' field
                    </li>
                    <li><b>willpower</b> <i>(optional)</i>: The willpower of a character or location card, so how much
                        damage it can take before they are discarded. For other card types, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>

                Certain text fields ('abilities', 'clarifications', 'effects', 'errata', 'fullText') can have special
                Unicode characters in them that resemble the game-specific icons as closely as possible:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>⟳</b> (Unicode character \u27F3): Exert</li>
                    <li><b>⬡</b> (Unicode character \u2B21): Ink (usually in activation costs)</li>
                    <li><b>◊</b> (Unicode character \u25CA): Lore (usually used to indicate the lore gain when questing)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>¤</b> (Unicode character \u00A4): Strength</li>
                    <li><b>⛉</b> (Unicode character \u26C9): Willpower</li>
                    <li><b>•</b> (Unicode character \u2022): Bullet point that separates different subtypes, and is also
                        used in lists on cards (for instance 'Maui's Fish Hook', ID 568)
                    </li>

                The source of all this data is the same as the official <i>Disney Lorcana</i> app uses, with extra image
                parsing to make the card text more accurate. This means that LorcanaJSON files don't contain all cards
                teased for the next set release.<br/>
                Once the new set cards get added to the official app, they will also get added to the LorcanaJSON data
                files
                within a few days.<br/>
                The data files also don't contain any information about 'Enchanted'-rarity cards or links to their art.
