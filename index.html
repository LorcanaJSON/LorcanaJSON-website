        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
            This project aims to collect data about all the cards in the <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span>
            trading card game, and to make that data accessible in an easy-to-use format.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's aimed at developers of <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span> tools and websites, rather than
            players of the game. Having one source of data should save these developers time, since everybody
            doesn't individually have to collect and enter their own card data anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is not affiliated with Ravensburger or Disney.
        </p>

    <section id="datafiles">
        <h1>Data files explanation</h1>
        <p>
            There are four types of files: A metadata file; a file for each set and a zipfile with all individual set files; a file for each official deck and a zipfile with all individual deck files; and the file with all the cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each data file type has its own use and fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b class="filename">metadata.json</b> contains data about the data files. Storing these values
                    and occassionally retrieving just this file is an efficient way to check if the datafiles got
                    updated, in which case you need to redownload them to get the latest version of the card data.
                    This datablock is also included in the other data files under the "metadata" key. It consists of
                    these fields:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="field">formatVersion</b>:
                        A string indicating the formatting version of the files, in
                        <code class="version">major.minor.patch</code> format. If this version string changes, the
                        data structure was changed, and your tool that uses these data files might need
                        adjustments. You can check the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for the exact changes
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">generatedOn</b>:
                        An ISO 8601 formatted date and time string, indicating when the
                        data files were generated. If this field changes, new cards may have been added or existing ones changed.
                        You can check the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for the exact changes
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">language</b>:
                        A two-letter code indicating which language this metadata is for: "de" for German, "en" for English, "fr" for French, and "it" for Italian
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b class="filename">setdata.[setCode].json</b> contains data on all the cards in the set specified by
                the set code. There is a file like this for each released set. Each setdata file consists of these fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="field">allowedInFormats</b>:
                        This dictionary has for each official Constructed format (Currently "Core" and "Infinity") data on whether this set is allowed in official tournaments, and when it rotates out if it does.
                        Available fields are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b class="field">allowed</b>: A boolean indicating whether this set is allowed to be used in official tournaments in this format</li>
                            <li><b class="optional field">allowedUntilDate</b>: If a date is known when this set rotates out of this format, this field exists and is set to the date until when the set is allowed to be used. If no date is known, this field doesn't exist</li>
                            <li><b class="optional field">rotationGroup</b>: If this format uses set rotations, this field is set to a number indicating a group of sets that rotate out at the same time (so Set 1 to 4 have the same 'rotationGroup' for Core).
                                If this format doesn't use rotations, this field doesn't exist</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">allowedInTournamentsFromDate</b>:
                        A date string saying from when this set was or will be allowed to be used in official tournaments. If that date isn't known, or if the set isn't allowed in any official tournaments, this field is set to 'null'
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">code</b>:
                        The code of this set. This is already in the name of the set file, but it's here too for completion's sake
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">hasAllCards</b>:
                        A boolean indicating whether all cards for this set have been released yet.
                        <code class="json-keyword">true</code> if all main cards (so excluding promos) of the set are in the datafile,
                        <code class="json-keyword">false</code> otherwise
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">metadata</b>:
                        Contains the same metadata fields as in metadata.json, as described above
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">name</b>:
                        The full name of this set
                    </li>
                   <li><b class="field">number</b>:
                        The number of the set, within the set's 'type'. So both setcode "1" and "Q1" have 'number' 1, since the former is expansion 1 and the latter is quest 1. See also the <code class="field ref">type</code> field
                    </li>
                     <li><b class="field">prereleaseDate</b>:
                        The pre-release date for this set, when it was or will be available to buy from local game stores. Format is year-month-day. If the pre-release date isn't known yet, the value is 'null'
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">releaseDate</b>:
                        The release date for this set, when it was or will be available to buy from large retailers. Format is year-month-day. If the release date isn't known yet, the value is 'null'
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">type</b>:
                        What type of set this is. Most sets are type <code class="on-card">expansion</code>, but sets like 'Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble' are type <code class="on-card">quest</code>. The latter type may be missing some fields or values, and cards from these sets aren't allowed to be used during tournaments or official games
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">cards</b>:
                        A list of card objects. The fields of each card object are described in the section below
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b class="filename">deckdata.[deckCode].json</b> and <b class="filename">deckdata.[deckCode].full.json</b> contain data on all the cards in the deck specified by
                the deck code. The difference between the files is that the file with '.full' in the name contains full data on each card, whereas the other file only contains deck-specific card data. Each deck file consists of these fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="field">colors</b>:
                        A list of the card colors that this deck uses. Decks usually have two colors, but Ursula's deck in Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble doesn't have any, and the Gateway reward packs have four
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">deckGroup</b>:
                        The code of the group this deck belongs to. For instance, with each new set they release two or three starter decks, and each of the starter decks for one set would have the same <code class="field">deckGroup</code> value
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">foilIds</b>:
                        A lot of decks include foil versions of one or more cards. For instance, starter decks contain foil versions of the cards on the packaging. This field contains a list of IDs of the cards that are foil in this deck
                    </li>
                    <li><b class="field">metadata</b>:
                        Contains the same metadata fields as in metadata.json, as described above

                    <li><b class="optional field">name</b>:
                        Some decks have a name. Starter decks for instance list the name on the back of the packaging. If a deck has a name, it's in this field. If it doesn't have a name, this field doesn't exist.
                        <i><b>Help wanted</b>:: While the names of the English starter decks are easy to find, it's far harder for starter decks in other languages.

            The <code class="filename ref">allCards.json</code> file and all the set files have a
            <code class="field ref">cards</code> field, which contains a list of card objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section describes the v2 format version. For the old deprecated v1 format version fields, <a href="cardExplanations_formatV1.html">click here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of those card objects consists of the following fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="optional field">abilities</b>:
                A list of abilities of a Character, Location, or Item card. For cards without abilities, this field doesn't exist. Each ability entry is a dictionary containing (some of) the following fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="field">fullText</b> contains the entire ability text as printed on the card, including newline characters</li>
                    <li><b class="field">type</b> indicates what type of ability this is, one of 'activated' (pay cost to activate effect), 'keyword' (prenamed abilities), 'static' (always active), or 'triggered' (activated on certain events)</li>
                    <li>
                        'keyword'-type abilities are prenamed abilities, and ability entries with this type have the following extra fields:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b class="field">keyword</b> contains the name of the ability's keyword ('Ward', 'Resist', etc.)</li>
                            <li><b class="optional field">keywordValue</b> contains the 'value' part of a keyword, so for 'Resist +1', this field would contain the '+1' part. For abilities like 'Shift: Discard an Action card', this field contains the part after the colon</li>
                            <li><b class="optional field">keywordValueNumber</b> contains the numeric part of the <code class="field">keywordValue</code>, if it is numeric. So for 'Resist +1', this would be 1</li>
                            <li><b class="optional field">reminderText</b> contains just the reminder text of a keyword ability, so the part between brackets. Most but not all cards with keyword abilities have reminder text for those keywords</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other types of abilities are named abilities, and they have the following extra fields:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b class="field">effect</b> is the text of what the ability actually does</li>
                            <li><b class="field">name</b> is the name of the ability, shown at the start of the ability in a distinct label
                            <li>
                                'activated'-type abilities are abilities that require you to actively pay a cost (exerting, paying ink, etc.) before the effect fires. Ability entries with this type have the following extra fields:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b class="field">costs</b> is a list of each separate cost that needs to be paid to be able to activate this ability</li>
                                    <li><b class="field">costsText</b> is the costs as a single string</li>

                A list of the name(s) of the artist(s) that drew the art for this card, as written on the bottom left of the card. This will usually contain just one entry, but some cards have multiple artists.

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">artistsNormalized</b>:
                Artist names aren't always consistent between sets. If a card uses one or more artist names that have changed since, or were abbreviated on this card, this field will exist and contain the consistent or preferred name(s) of the artist(s),
                in the same order as the <code class="field ref">artists</code>-list. If the artist name(s) are fine as written on the card, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">artists</code> and <code class="field ref">artistsText</code> fields

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">iconicId</b>:
                For cards that have an Iconic-rarity version, this field contains the ID of that Iconic card. For other cards, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">baseId</code> field

            <li><b class="field">id</b>:
                A unique number identifying the card. For the first set, this id is identical to the <code class="field ref">number</code> field;

                        For cards that don't have different art for their foil version, this field doesn't exist
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Note: If the <code class="field ref">isExternalReveal</code> field exists and is set to
                <code class="json-keyword">true</code>, this card isn't in the official app yet, so only the
                'full' image field will be set
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">inkwell</b>:
                <code class="json-keyword">true</code> if this card is allowed to be put into the inkwell as ink,

            <li><b class="optional field">isExternalReveal</b>:

                app, but the card image came from another official Ravensburger source. Practically, this means that the
                <code class="field ref">images</code> field will probably only have the <code class="field ref">full</code> URL set,
                and it will be in another format than usual. This field doesn't exist if the data for this card came from the official app
            </li>

            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">maxCopiesInDeck</b>:
                When building a deck, you can usually add a maximum of 4 copies of a card to that deck. Some cards are exceptions to that rule. For those cards, this field exists and is set to the maximum amount that applies for this card.
                See for example the card <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy - Tail Wagger</code> (IDs 436-440): the card allows 99 copies of it in a deck, so the value of this field is set to '99'.
                If the card allows an unlimited amount of copies, like <code class="card-name">Microbots</code> (ID 1366), this field is set to 'null'. If no special limit applies, this field doesn't exist

            <li><b class="field">name</b>:
                The main name of the card. For characters and locations, this is the character or location name without the small version subtitle (So the "Minnie Mouse" part of "Minnie Mouse - Stylish Surfer").
                For other card types, this is the same as the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field. See also the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> and <code class="field ref">version</code> fields
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field"><s>nonEnchantedId</s></b>:

                Special versions of some cards are released at events or at other occasions, as promo versions.

                For 'Special'-rarity cards, this number is the promo number instead, so a set might have two cards with number 1, one Special and one non-Special.
                This doesn't necessarily mean the cards are related, for that see the <code class="field ref">promoIds</code> and <code class="field ref">nonSpecialId</code> fields.
                For a unique card identifier, see the <code class="field ref">id</code> field

            <li><b class="optional field">promoGrouping</b>:
                This field contains which grouping a promo card belongs to. A grouping is different from a setcode. For instance, the promo card <code class="card-name">Minnie Mouse - Wide-Eyed Diver</code> (ID 674) has the full identifier '16/P1 • EN • 2'.
                The grouping here is 'P1'. Cards from different sets can belong to the same grouping. Available groupings are 'P1', 'P2', 'C1', 'C2', 'D23'; more will probably be added at a later time. This field doesn't exist for non-promo cards

                Cards that don't have a special way to obtain them don't have this field. See also the <code class="field ref">promoSourceCategory</code> field

                    A string representation of the set code, which is the set number for 'normal' cards, and <code class="on-card">Q1</code> for Illumineer's Quest cards. This is exactly how it's printed as the last part of the identifier at the bottom-left of each card.<br />
                    This set code is also a key in the "sets" dictionary inside the "allCards.json" file, linking to the set name and other set data.<br />

                The full name like in the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field, but simplified: without the dash between name and version subtitle (for character and location cards),
                without special characters like '!' and '.', and entirely in lower-case.
                Special versions of letters are simplified too (for instance: "Te Kā - The Burning One" has the simpleName "te ka the burning one").
                Quotemarks in possessives ("captain colonel's lieutenant") and dashes between words ("minnie mouse wide-eyed diver") <i>are</i> kept, since that's related to basic spelling.
                This field should make it easier to implement this data in a search engine, since most people won't use the dash or other special characters when searching for a card,
                so you can match their query against this field. See also the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> field
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">story</b>:
                The name of the story (movie, TV show, etc.) that the card is from or that it references
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">strength</b>:
                The strength of a character card, so how much damage it does to another character during a
                challenge. For card types other than characters, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">subtypes</b>:
                A list of the subtypes of this card. For characters, this can have entries like <code class="on-card">Dreamborn</code> and <code class="on-card">Princess</code>.
                For song actions, this contains 'Song'. The order of the list is the same as on the card. For cards without subtypes, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field">subtypesText</code> field
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">subtypesText</b>:
                If this card has one or more subtypes, this field contains those subtypes as one string, just like it's printed on the card.
                For cards without subtypes, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field">subtypes</code> field
            </li>
            <li><b class="field">type</b>:
                What kind of card this is. One of Action, Character, Item, Location
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">variant</b>:
                Some cards have multiple variants that only have different art (for instance <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy</code> has ID 436 to 440).
                These are differentiated by a letter after the card number (for <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy</code>, letters 'a' to 'e').
                This field contains that letter. For cards without variants, this field doesn't exist.
                See also the <code class="field ref">variantIds</code> field
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">variantIds</b>:
                Some cards have multiple variants that only have different art (for instance <code class="card-name">Dalmatian Puppy</code> has ID 436 to 440).
                This field contains a list of the IDs of the other cards belonging to this variant. For cards without variants, this field doesn't exist.
                See also the <code class="field ref">variant</code> field
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">varnishType</b>:
                A few cards have a special varnish effect. If this card is varnished, this field exists and is set to the exact varnish type.
                For cards that don't have a varnish effect, this field doesn't exist.
                See also the <code class="field">varnishMask</code> subfield of the <code class="field">images</code> dictionary
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">version</b>:
                The version subtitle of a character or location card, written below the <code class="field">name</code> (So the "Stylish Surfer" part of "Minnie Mouse - Stylish Surfer").
                For other card types, this field doesn't exist. See also the <code class="field ref">fullName</code> and <code class="field ref">name</code> fields
            </li>
            <li><b class="optional field">willpower</b>:
                The willpower of a character or location card, so how much damage it can take before it is banished. For other card types, this field doesn't exist
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="field-explanation-decks">Deck files</h2>
        The deck files also have a <code class="field">cards</code> field with card objects.
        The difference between the <code class="filename">deckdata.[deckCode].json</code> and the <code class="filename">deckdata.[deckCode].full.json</code> deckfiles is that the card objects in the former only contain the following fields, while the card objects in the latter, '.full', deck files contain these fields in addition to all the fields listed above.
        The fields specific to card objects in the deck files are:
        <ul>
            <li><b class="field">amount</b>: How many copies of this card are in the deck</li>
            <li><b class="field">id</b>: The ID of the card, uniquely identifying it. See the explanation for the <code class="field">id</code> field in the <a href="#field-explanation">Card data fields explanation</a> section for a more extensive explanation</li>
            <li><b class="field">isFoil</b>: Whether the card is foil in this deck. If 'true', the <code class="field">id</code> of this card is then also in the <code class="field">foilIds</code> field of the deck</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For each deck, there are two flavors: The basic file, and the 'full' file.
            In the former, each card entry only contains deck-specific fields as described in the 'deckdata' part of the <a href="#datafiles">Data files explanation</a>, so if you're already parsing the 'allCards.json' file, this is all you need.
            In the 'full' file, on top of the deck-specific fields each card entry also contains all the card fields as described in the <a href="#field-explanation">Card data fields explanation</a> section.

        <h2 id="downloads-cockatrice">Cockatrice Download</h2>
        <p>
            This section contains downloads for use in <a href="https://cockatrice.github.io/" target="_blank">Cockatrice</a>, a free program to play tabletop card games.<br />
            These files are experimental, so they may change. Please send in any oddities, bugs, or suggestions, see the <a href="#contact">Contact section</a> for how to do that.<br />
            Most <i>Lorcana</i> card fields map to the <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> field names that Cockatrice uses. The main exceptions are:
            <ul>
                <li>'Lore' in <i>Lorcana</i> uses the 'Loyalty' field in <i>Magic: The Gathering</i></li>
                <li>Where <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> uses 'Mana', <i>Lorcana</i> uses 'Ink'</li>
                <li>Location move cost in <i>Lorcana</i> doesn't have an equivalent in <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, so that isn't stored in this XML</li>
                <li>'Strength' in <i>Lorcana</i> is called 'Power' in <i>Magic: The Gathering</i></li>
                <li>'Willpower' in <i>Lorcana</i> is called 'Toughness' in <i>Magic: The Gathering</i></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>How to install/update</b>: As explained on <a href="https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Custom-Cards-&-Sets#to-add-custom-sets-follow-these-steps">this Cockatrice wiki page</a>, to install one of these files, follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Download the XML or zipped XML file in your preferred language</li>
                <li>If you downloaded the zipped XML file, unzip it</li>
                <li>In Cockatrice, in the top menu bar click 'Card Database' and select 'Open custom sets folder'</li>
                <li>A file explorer window should have popped up pointing to Cockatrice's custom sets folder; place the downloaded XML file there</li>
                <li>Restart Cockatrice, or click the 'Card Database' menu and select 'Reload card database'</li>
                <li>Cockatrice should report that it found new sets and ask whether you want to enable them, click 'Yes'</li>
                <li>To verify that the cards were loaded properly, search for 'Minnie Mouse' in the 'Deck:' tab of Cocktrice. If it lists cards, it worked!</li>
                <li>If no cards were found, go to the 'Card Databases' menu, select 'Manage sets...', search for 'Lorcana', and make sure all listed sets are enabled</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Some <i>Lorcana</i> cards have the same name as <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> cards, and Cockatrice will prefer the MtG version. This can be (mostly) solved by picking the correct printing. If the Printing picker isn't visible, go to 'View' -> 'Printing' and click 'Visible'.<br />
            If you only want to play with <i>Lorcana</i> cards and not with any <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> ones, you can go to the 'Cockatrice' menu, 'Settings', and in the 'Card database' field point it to your local LorcanaJSON Cockatrice XML file.

        </h1>
        <p>
            The source of all this data is the same as the official <span class="lorcana">Disney Lorcana</span> app uses, with extra image parsing to make the card text more accurate.
            This means that LorcanaJSON files don't contain all cards teased for the next set release.<br />
            Once the new set cards get added to the official app, they will also get added to the LorcanaJSON data files within a few days.
